Questions to ask self
  - is my conclusion tied to reality?

  - Ok, so I'm feeling down. Big deal (没什么). What can I learn from it?  What happened? How can I make myself feel better?

Focus
  - 我们自己做的三明治。
  - change our focus. change our questions. the question create a new reality.
  - fault-finder think 糟糕的现实和自己没有关系, but they did not realize that they create that reality. 他们觉得不论什么工作，boss都很坏；不论什么同事，都会考虑不周，搞砸一切。
  - find the miracle in the common
  - we co-create our reality
  - 危机往往是潜在的成长的机会
  - learn to fail, and fail to learn
  - focus on the most important things
