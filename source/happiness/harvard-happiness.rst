对工作的理解
  - Job

    - motivation: paycheck
    - attitude: "I have to do" "I have no choice"
    - expectation: nothing much. TGIF or holiday, break, the end of semester

  - Career

    - motivation: money, advancement
    - attitude: "It's a race, a race to the top" rat race
    - expectation: more prestige, more power, more money

  - Calling (使命)

    - motivation: the thing in itself
    - attitude: mission "It's what they are meant to be done" "我愿意做，比其他任何事情都愿意做"
    - expectation: more work. so that thay can be all they can be.

"Be the change you want to see in the world."
If you want a happier world, begin with yourself.


What we can't live without?
What can't you live without?
What are you about?


setting goals method

  - write them down. it is make a commitment.
  - set lifelies. it will motivate you.
  - make them specific.


The most important thing about goals is not achieving those goals, it's not that is what makes us happy or sad if we do or don't achieve them.
The key is to  energize us, to motivate us, to liberate us, to contribute as a mean toward the end, the end being the journey.

"信念是自我实现的预言"

take break.


The problem is lacking of recovery.


change our perception of our day from being marathon runners to being sprinters, from going on and on and on to sprinting, recovering, sprinting, recoverying.


Have 60 to 120 minutes, so around 90 minutes of sprint, work, concentrate, focus hard, go for it, and then after that, after you sprint with as little distraction as possible, have (at least) 15 minutes or so of recovery.


每周划出10个90分钟的工作时间段，保持灵活性。


attain multi-level recovery
  - First recovery, the micro level, 15 minutes mediation, one-hour of gym
  - Middle, the midst level recovery, good night sleep, a day off during the week
  - Finally, those vacations


"Recreation lead to creation"
